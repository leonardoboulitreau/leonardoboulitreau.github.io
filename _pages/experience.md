## Where I’ve Been
**(2025-Current) - Intern [@Télecom Paris](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * High-quality and expressive music generation on audio informed with structure.
  * Dataset processing.

**(2023-2025) - Researcher [@CPqD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Improved a hybrid ASR by adapting its LM on synthetic domain-specific text generated by LoRA of LLMs.
  * Evaluated fairness of the company’s ASR on multi-accented speech in the Brazilian Portuguese language.
  * Developed an accurate and efficient two-stage SSL-based speech emotion recognition system.
  * Enriched the company’s call center customer profiler by developing a SOTA speech age and gender classifier.
    
**(2021-2023) - Fellow Master [@CPqD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Implemented neural customer-oriented expressive TTS models for the Brazilian Portuguese language.
  * Enabled customers to edit synthesized audios with character-level prosody control on the ONNX FastPitch.
  * Conducted perceptual experiments to evaluate speech naturalness, emotion intensity, and speaker similarity.
    
**(2020-2021) - Internship @LPS**
  * Enhanced lab automation by designing neural speech commands recognition systems.
  * Encapsulated the command recognition system in a local private LoRa network for IoT applications.
  * Enabled long distance voice control by developing a wearable prototype with an embedded microphone.
