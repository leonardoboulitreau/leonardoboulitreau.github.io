## I make machines that sing, speak, play, and hear.
I am a researcher in the intersection of audio and deep learning currently working as a Music Generation intern at Telecom Paris. I have five years of experience in the field and a background in signal processing. I am also a hobbyist music producer, composer, programmer and guitarist.

## Interests
Developing audio‑based machines that are transparent and human‑empowering in topics such as: 
* Differentiable Digital Signal Processing
* Singing Voice
* Sound Matching
* Music/Speech Generation & Recognition
* Neural Audio Effects
* Speech Emotion, Age and Gender Recognition

## Selected Works
  * Interspeech's SER Challenge (2025): [Improving Speech Emotion Recognition Through Cross Modal Attention Alignment and Balanced Stacking Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20007)
  * Master's Thesis (2024): [Cross-Speaker Style Transfer for TTS with Singing Voice Conversion Data Augmentation, Style Filtering, and F0 Matching](https://repositorio.unicamp.br/Busca/Download?codigoArquivo=585009&tipoMidia=0)
  * Interspeech's SynData4GenAI (2024): [Exploring synthetic data for cross-speaker style transfer in style representation based TTS](https://www.isca-archive.org/syndata4genai_2024/ueda24_syndata4genai.pdf)
