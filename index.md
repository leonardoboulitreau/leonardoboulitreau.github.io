### I make machines that speak, sing, play, and hear.

I am a researcher in the intersection of audio and deep learning, with over 5 years of experience and a solid background in signal processing. I am also a hobbyist music producer, composer, and multi‑instrumentalist.

## Interests
My research interests are aimed at developing audio‑based systems that are more transparent and human‑empowering in topics such as: 

* Singing Voice/Style Conversion (SVC)
* Differentiable Digital Signal Processing
* Neural Audio Effects
* Music/Speech Synthesis
* Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
* Speech Emotion, Age and Gender Recognition

## Skills
  * **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sci-Kit, HuggingFace, ONNX, Gradio
  * **Frameworks**: Lightning, Amphion, Coqui, SpeechBrain, ESPNET, Kaldi
  * **Tools**: Docker, Git, Cloud (AWS, GCP)
  * **Programming**: Python, C, C++, MATLAB, LaTeX
  * **Languages**: Portuguese, English, French
  * **Competences**: Paper Implementation, Experiment Design, Team Collaboration

## Work Experience
**(2023-Current) - AI+Speech Researcher [@CPqD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Currently evaluating synthetic LLM textual data for ASR domain‑specific improvement.
  * Evaluated fairness on multi‑accented speech recognition for the Brazilian Portuguese language.
  * Improved the company’s emotion recognition system in production, in terms of speed and performance, by developing a 2‑step emotion recognition architecture (ECAPA‑TDNN + HuBERT Emotion Classifier)
  * Enriched the company’s call center customer profiling product by developing and sending to production speech age and gender classifier models.
    
**(2021-2023) - Fellow Master [@CPqD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Developed neural customer‑oriented expressive speech synthesis models for the Brazilian Portuguese language.
  * Enabled customers to edit the synthesized audios’ prosody in a fine‑grained way by implementing character‑level prosody control on the ONNX version of the FastPitch TTS model.
  * Conducted several subjective perceptual experiments to evaluate synthetic audio quality, naturalness and expresiveness.
    
**(2020-2021) - Lab Intern @LPS**
  * Enhanced lab automation by designing a neural speech commands recognition system.
  * Encapsulated an ASR system in a local private LoRa network for IoT purposes.
  * Enabled long distance voice control by developing a wearable prototype with an embedded microphone.
