## I make machines that sing, speak, play, and hear.
I am a researcher in the intersection of audio and deep learning currently working as a Music Generation intern at Telecom Paris. I have five years of experience in the field and a background in signal processing. I am also a hobbyist music producer, composer, programmer and guitarist.

## Interests
My research interests are aimed at developing audio‑based systems that are transparent and human‑empowering in topics such as: 
* Differentiable Digital Signal Processing
* Singing Voice/Style Conversion
* Neural Audio Effects
* Music/Speech Synthesis
* Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
* Speech Emotion, Age and Gender Recognition

## Selected Works

  * [Master's Thesis: Cross-Speaker Style Transfer for TTS with Singing Voice Conversion Data Augmentation, Style Filtering, and F0 Matching](https://repositorio.unicamp.br/Busca/Download?codigoArquivo=575266&tipoMidia=0)
  * [SynData4GenAI: Exploring synthetic data for cross-speaker style transfer in style representation based TTS](https://www.isca-archive.org/syndata4genai_2024/ueda24_syndata4genai.pdf)
  * [GENEA: Gesture Generation with Diffusion Models Aided by Speech Activity Information](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3610661.3616554)

## Experience

**(2025-Current) - Internship [@Télecom Paris](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Conducting research and dataset processing on low-resource informed music generation in audio.

**(2023-2025) - Researcher [@CPqD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Improved a hybrid ASR by adapting its LM on synthetic domain-specific text generated by LoRA of LLMs.
  * Evaluated fairness of the company’s ASR on multi-accented speech in the Brazilian Portuguese language.
  * Developed an accurate and efficient two-stage SSL-based speech emotion recognition system.
  * Enriched the company’s call center customer profiler by developing a SOTA speech age and gender classifier.
    
**(2021-2023) - Fellow Master [@CPqD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Implemented neural customer-oriented expressive TTS models for the Brazilian Portuguese language.
  * Enabled customers to edit synthesized audios with character-level prosody control on the ONNX FastPitch.
  * Conducted perceptual experiments to evaluate speech naturalness, emotion intensity, and speaker similarity.
    
**(2020-2021) - Internship @LPS**
  * Enhanced lab automation by designing neural speech commands recognition systems.
  * Encapsulated the command recognition system in a local private LoRa network for IoT applications.
  * Enabled long distance voice control by developing a wearable prototype with an embedded microphone.
