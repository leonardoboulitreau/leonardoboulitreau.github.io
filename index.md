### I make machines that sing, speak, play, and hear.

I am a researcher in the intersection of audio and deep learning, with over 5 years of experience and a solid background in signal processing. I am also a hobbyist music producer, composer, and multi‑instrumentalist.

## Interests
My research interests are aimed at developing audio‑based systems that are more transparent and human‑empowering in topics such as: 

* Singing Voice/Style Conversion (SVC)
* Differentiable Digital Signal Processing
* Neural Audio Effects
* Music/Speech Synthesis
* Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
* Speech Emotion, Age and Gender Recognition

## Skills
  * **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sci-Kit, HuggingFace, ONNX, Gradio
  * **Frameworks**: Lightning, Amphion, Coqui, SpeechBrain, ESPNET, Kaldi
  * **Tools**: Docker, Git, Cloud (AWS, GCP)
  * **Programming**: Python, C, C++, MATLAB, LaTeX
  * **Languages**: Portuguese, English, French
  * **Competences**: Paper Implementation, Experiment Design, Team Collaboration

## Work Experience
**(2025-Current) - Internship [@Télecom Paris](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Conducting research and dataset processing on low-resource informed music generation in audio.

**(2023-2025) - Researcher [@CPqD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Improved a hybrid ASR by adapting its LM on synthetic domain-specific text generated by LoRA of LLMs.
  * Evaluated fairness of the company’s ASR on multi-accented speech in the Brazilian Portuguese language.
  * Developed an accurate and efficient two-stage SSL-based speech emotion recognition system.
  * Enriched the company’s call center customer profiler by developing a SOTA speech age and gender classifier.
    
**(2021-2023) - Fellow Master [@CPqD](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpqd/)**
  * Implemented neural customer-oriented expressive TTS models for the Brazilian Portuguese language.
  * Enabled customers to edit synthesized audios with character-level prosody control on the ONNX FastPitch.
  * Conducted perceptual experiments to evaluate speech naturalness, emotion intensity, and speaker similarity.
    
**(2020-2021) - Internship @LPS**
  * Enhanced lab automation by designing neural speech commands recognition systems.
  * Encapsulated the command recognition system in a local private LoRa network for IoT applications.
  * Enabled long distance voice control by developing a wearable prototype with an embedded microphone.
